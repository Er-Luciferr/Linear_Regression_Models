# Algerian Forest Fires Linear Regression

This repo contains the code and data for a linear regression ML model that predicts the FWI of forest fires in Algeria based on meteorological and other factors. The data was obtained from kaggle , which contains 244 instances of forest fires from 2012 . The code is written in Python using scikit-learn and pandas libraries.

The main steps of the project are:

- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Flask 

To run the code, you need to install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. 

I hope this helps you for learning . If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me. Thank you for visiting my repo! ðŸ˜Š
